# Missing data

The DENV linelist data files are large and partly confidential and have thus been ommitted from Github.
The data can be found on the Bento group Box in the folder `DENV > linelist_to_serotypes > data > linelist_data > composite_dataset`.

The following data are confidential:

+ `composite_dataset/composite_1996.csv`
+ `composite_dataset/composite_1997.csv`
+ `composite_dataset/composite_1998.csv`
+ `composite_dataset/composite_1999.csv`

The following public data are "broken" (but we have a confidential working copy)

+ `composite_dataset/composite_2008.csv`

All other publicy available data can be downloaded here: https://datasus.saude.gov.br/transferencia-de-arquivos/#
